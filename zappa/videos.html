          <p class="video-description">
            This is a performance of one of Frank Zappa's most famous and
            renowned compositions: Montana (A Token Of His Extreme). Zappa
            released this song on his 1973 LP Over-Nite Sensation. It is the
            last track on the album and features backing vocals by Tina Turner
            and the Ikettes. This particular recording was filmed on August 27,
            1974 in Hollywood. The song is about a person moving to Montana so
            they can "grow a crop of dental floss" to become a "dental floss
            tycoon". This is my favorite Frank Zappa song.

          <p class="video-description">
            This is a video of a portion of Zappa's guitar solo in a performance
            of Montana in Stockholm 1973. This clip features Zappa's
            improvisational genius as he shreds with the Mothers of Invention
            jamming along in the background. The look on George Duke's face(The
            keyboard player) is one of pure bliss. This is also a personal
            favorite of mine.

          <p class="video-description">
            This is the music video to Inca Roads performed by Zappa and the
            Mothers of Invention. The surrealistic lyrics of this song explore
            ancient civilizations and their mystical beliefs, touching on themes
            of spirituality and the mysteries of the universe. This video also
            features claymation from the talented Bruce Bickford, a clay
            animation artist that worked many times with Zappa.

          <p class="video-description">
            Watermelon in Easter Hay is one of Frank Zappa's most soulful and
            beautiful pieces. This performance took place on May 17th 1988 in
            Palace De Deportes Barcelone. Many see this song as the definitive
            masterpiece of Zappa's works.
